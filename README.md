# Financial Trends Prediction through Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This project is inspired by the article "Expected Returns and Large Language Models" by Yifei Chen and others. The aim of the project is to extract contextualized representations of news text from large language models (LLMs) and then utilize these, along with other financial data from financial APIs, to enhance models predicting expected stock returns. 
The project includes the following stages: Data Scraping, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Engineering, and Prediction Model.
